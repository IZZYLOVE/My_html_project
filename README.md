# My_html_project
This is a project to build a websit without C S S, we are only allowed to add very 
few css snipets only where necessary.

There are only three C S S snippets in this work: The body tag to set font size,
the navigation to color the active nave button and the table in the training.html
to collapse the border line. This project without C S S is a work of art.
